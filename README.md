## Learning Goals:
At the time of this project, I am a student at Turing School of Software Engineering in the front end development program, in mod 2. This is a project that I did in my own time, in order to prepare for our lesson on learning React in mod 3. I pre-read the <a href="https://frontend.turing.edu/lessons/module-3/react-2-the-how.html"> IdeaBox lesson from Turing's mod 3 curriculum</a>, and converted the class component based React into functional component based React.
